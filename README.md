# Insight-Project

Objectives of Insight : 
- Provide a platform for individuals to connect with others who may be experiencing similar mental health challenges.
- Encourage individuals to engage in self-care activities such as journaling, mood tracking, sketching, and a daily task or activity to complete that promotes positive
mental health habits and routine.
- Offer a chatbot that provides a non-judgmental and supportive space for users to discuss their mental health concerns and receive immediate guidance and resources.
- Create a space accessible and available to everyone, no matter how far or who they are. Inclusivity and equality is our motto.
